Made By Daniel Enesi, do not copy, do not pirate.

I used Python itertools to generate a list of "pins", and then stored them in a folder.
I stored them so that they can be gotten immediately, instead of computed at runtime because
that would take much time.
Then, running on the Python HTTP server, the web project uses JavaScript to fetch
the "pins" and display them as patterns, and also allows the user to create his or her own patterns
