# Phone Patterns

Made By Daniel Enesi. Please ensure proper attribution to code.

## Description

This project uses Python's `itertools` to generate a list of "pins" (patterns). These pins are stored in a folder for quick access, avoiding the need for runtime computation which can be time-consuming. 

The project runs on a Python HTTP server and utilizes JavaScript to fetch and display the pins as patterns. Additionally, it allows users to create their own patterns.

## Features

- Pre-generated list of pins for quick access
- Display of pin patterns using JavaScript
- User can create custom patterns
